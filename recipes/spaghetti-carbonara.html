    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is said that <em>carbonara</em> was first made in 1944 in Rome. A roman cook gathered the few ingredients available to the american soldiers, eggs, bacon and cheese, and turned them into the recipe we all know and love nowadays.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Guanciale</li>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Cheese (pecorino romano)</li>
        <li>Seasonings: salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook guanciale in oil until is brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Boil the spaghetti in salted water, drain and cook them a little in the same pan where you have cooked guanciale (this adds some taste).</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, 1/2 of the cheese, and some pepper in a bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add some more cheese and pepper if you wish.</li>
